              What are your core beliefs and principles?
              I strive to live a life of integrity, compassion, and continuous learning. I believe in the power of collaboration and am committed to making a positive impact on the world.
              
              To get started, think about moments when you felt particularly proud of yourself or inspired by others. What qualities or actions contributed to those positive experiences?
              What qualities do you admire in your friends or family?
              Are there any specific experiences that have shaped your values?
              What kind of person do you want to be remembered as?

      <h1>More Info</h1>
      <p>My name is Sakiru Ayanyemi GANIYU, I am a dentists by training and I am rounding up my master of public health in Western Sydney University.
        My core value is to live a life of integrity, a life that is full of compassion and a life of continuous learning.
        I believe so much in the power of collaboration and I am committed to making positive impact in the world.
        I could remember when u step my feet on the shore of Australia, I have never  travelled that long before but I have one thing at the back of my mind, to go through uncharted water.
        I could also remember when I became a dentist despite all odds, walking that aile to take my certificate was one of the proudest moments of life. 
        I am a person that is full of kindness, the reason I give is because I know what is means to have nothing. I am full of compassion and I work hard as if everything depends on work. I perceive because I normally have the future, the end at the back of my mind. I have the tunnel vision, that it may be difficult though but I want to fix my gaze on the goal.
        I am full of humility, I am open-minded, I am someone that is curious, I want to learn new things.
        One of my life long goal is to establish a university. It has been a dream from my childhood. I believe so much in the power of education. I know we my not be able prepare the future for our people but via education we can prepare our people for tomorrow. So that is my life long goal.  Thank you</p>
